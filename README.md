# SmokeFX Simulator

## Project Overview

SmokeFX Simulator is a particle simulation project under development, focusing on the creation and manipulation of smoke and steam
effects. The core idea is to build a solid foundation for particle simulation by gradually adding different functionalities and
effects in layers, allowing the user to experiment with and combine these effects in real-time.

The goal is to have a single "Modular Simulation Engine" that can be dynamically configured by enabling and disabling different
stages of simulation complexity, providing granular control over particle behavior.

## Features (Simulation Functionalities)

The following functionalities will be implemented cumulatively, meaning each new functionality builds upon the previous ones. They
will be togglable (on/off) independently within the simulation:

* **1. Constant Speed:**
    * Particles are launched from the emitter with a constant speed and direction.
* **2. Smooth Stop:**
    * Particles start with an initial velocity but gradually decelerate to a stop over their lifetime.
* **3. Decreasing Alpha:**
    * In addition to decelerating, particles become increasingly transparent (their alpha decreases) over their lifetime until
      they vanish.
* **4. Increasing Size:**
    * Particles inherit the previous characteristics and, additionally, grow in size over time, stopping their growth in
      conjunction with the smooth stop effect.
* **5. Rotation:**
    * Particles, with all prior characteristics, also rotate around their own axis over time while being launched.
* **6. Texture:**
    * Particles will no longer be simple geometric shapes but will have a "smoke" texture applied to them, enhancing realism.
* **7. Steam Effect:**
    * Particles, with all prior characteristics, will be influenced by a subtle upward force over time, simulating the effect of
      steam or smoke rising.

### Game States

The project will utilize a state-based system to manage different screens of the application:

* **MenuState:** The initial screen with options to start the simulation, access settings, and exit.
* **ModularSimulationState:** The main simulation state where all the functionalities listed above can be activated/deactivated.
* **OptionsState:** A state for adjusting global application settings (e.g., FPS limit, emitter size).

## üéÆ How to Play (Pre-compiled Executable for Windows)

For users who want to run the simulation without compiling the code, a pre-compiled executable is available.

1. **Download the Release:**

* Go to the **[Releases]()** page of this repository.
* Download the latest `.zip` file under "Assets".

2. **Extract the Contents:**

* Unzip the downloaded file to a folder of your choice on your computer.

3. **Run the Simulation:**

* Navigate into the unzipped folder.
* Double-click `.exe` to start the simulation.

**Note:** This package is built for 64-bit Windows systems and includes all necessary dependencies, so you don't need to install
anything else.

## Getting Started Build the Project from Source

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.28 or higher)
* A C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW-w64 for Windows, GCC for Linux, Clang for macOS)
* [SFML 3.0.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.1/) (managed via CMake's FetchContent)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/vmaguiar/SmokeFX.git](https://github.com/vmaguiar/SmokeFX.git)
   cd SmokeFX
   ```
2. **Configure the project with CMake:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
3. **Compile the project:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
   Alternatively, if you are using an IDE like CLion, simply open the `SmokeFX` folder, and it should configure CMake
   automatically.

### Running

After compilation, the executable `SmokeFX.exe` (on Windows) or `SmokeFX` (on Linux/macOS) will be located in the `build/bin/`
folder.

You can run it directly:

```bash
./bin/SmokeFX # Or SmokeFX.exe on Windows
```
